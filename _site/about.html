  <p>I was born in Santiago, Chile.<br />
I’ve failed at many things. <br />
I tried to become a basketball player. Too short for that.<br />
I tried to become a professional dancer. I started too late, I got injured, and very disappointed.<br />
I tried to become a researcher in sociology. I did not get along with sociology. I wanted numbers, but sociology wanted theory.<br />
I tried to become a researcher in public policy and economics. We did get along for a while, but I did not have enough mathematics to offer.</p>

<p>I moved to the USA.<br />
I tried to become a researcher in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. We have a few amazing couples of years. But the demand for absolute devotion was too much for me. I also discover that science lied a lot to me. Life in academia was not what they told me. <br />
I discovered, very late, that I love computers, programming, data, and just casually thinking about the science oh human intelligence.</p>

<p>I still love basketball. I still do research, this time in computational cognitive science in a <a href="https://psych.wisc.edu/graduate-program/">PhD program</a>. I code and work with computers every day. I organize a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Madison/">Data Science Meetup group</a>. I like to help people to learn more about data science and cognitive science, although most people don’t need or ask for my help.</p>
